# Learn with Herm Video Game

Learn with Herm is a video game centered around helping students study effectively. Users can upload the content they wish to learn. Using AI-powered learning models such as the ChatGPT API, LWH analyzes the content, extracts the most important concepts, and auto-creates questions the user can use to quiz themselves. Instead of spending time generating questions or making flashcards/ notes, the user is able to allocate their time to actively learning and studying it.
